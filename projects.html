      <h2>Hospital Management System</h2>
      <p>Modern hospitals face challenges in efficiently managing appointments, 
        patient records, doctor availability, and real-time communication across departments. 
        This project addresses those challenges by offering a comprehensive, web-based Hospital Management System 
        developed using Django and .NET. It streamlines administrative and clinical workflows through secure, role-based access 
        for doctors, nurses, admins, and patients. By integrating REST APIs and providing a clean dashboard interface, the system enables real-time updates, appointment scheduling, and digital health record management. The goal is to reduce manual paperwork,
         enhance service quality, and ensure accurate, fast access to critical information in a clinical environment.</p>

      <h2>Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
      <p>Human emotions play a critical role in communication, yet recognizing them through 
        speech remains a challenging task. This project addresses that challenge by developing a 
        deep learning system that detects emotions—such as happiness, sadness, and anger—from raw audio input.
         By extracting MFCC features from .wav files and processing them through a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture,
          the model achieved an accuracy of over 85% across multiple emotion classes. The system is integrated into 
          an interactive Django web interface, allowing users to upload audio files and visualize predictions in real-time.
           This solution has potential applications in healthcare, customer support, and human-computer interaction.</p>

      <h2>Document QA with LlamaIndex</h2>
      <p>Modern document search engines often struggle with contextual understanding and relevance,
         especially when querying dense or unstructured files like PDFs. This project introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
         pipeline using LlamaIndex, FAISS, and OpenAI GPT-4 to solve that challenge. It enables users to upload documents, 
         which are automatically chunked, embedded, and indexed using Sentence-BERT and FAISS. When a query is submitted, 
         the most relevant context is retrieved and passed to GPT-4 to generate grounded, high-quality answers. 
         With a user-friendly Streamlit interface, the solution supports real-time Q&A, PDF uploads, and interactive 
         results—making document intelligence accessible, fast, and reliable.</p>

    <div class="description">
      <h2>YouTube Sentiment Analysis</h2>
      <p>Understanding public opinion on video content is crucial for creators and platforms alike. This project focuses on classifying YouTube comments into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. To address class imbalance and enhance model performance, SMOTE oversampling was applied. The project includes extensive preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualizations like ROC curves and confusion matrices. Beyond classification, it uses KMeans clustering and Apriori association rule mining to uncover behavioral patterns based on metadata like hashtags, links, and user types—offering both predictive power and deep insight into audience feedback.</p>

    <img src="images/segmentation.jpg" alt="Customer Segmentation">
    <div class="description">
      <h2>Customer Segmentation</h2>
      <p>This project focuses on segmenting customers based on behavior and predicting satisfaction levels using advanced machine learning and clustering techniques. Leveraging algorithms like Random Forest, SVC, and KMeans—combined with PCA for dimensionality reduction—the pipeline identifies distinct customer segments and insights into their needs. Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning (via RandomizedSearchCV), and data imputation were performed to ensure model robustness. The pipeline also includes visual tools such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots for interpretation. Trained models were exported using Joblib for deployment, making the system scalable and ready for integration into real-world business applications.</p>

    <div class="description">
      <h2>CIFAR-10 Classification with CNN</h2>
      <p>This project implements a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten object categories such as airplanes, cats, and trucks. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to extract spatial features and achieve over 80% classification accuracy. The training loop includes model checkpointing and automated evaluation using confusion matrices and key performance metrics. A retraining mechanism was introduced to focus on misclassified samples, improving overall accuracy by 6%. The trained model was saved using torch.save() for future inference or deployment, ensuring scalability and portability.</p>
